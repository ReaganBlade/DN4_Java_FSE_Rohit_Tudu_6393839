# âœ… Spring Boot REST Hands-On (Optional) Implementation Report

**Author:** Rohit Tudu
**Program:** Spring REST Hands-On (Backend Only)
**Frontend Exclusion:** Angular application integration was not part of the current curriculum scope. Hence, only Spring Boot backend tasks were implemented as per instructions.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

This report documents the completion of all backend hands-on tasks assigned as part of the Spring REST module using Java Spring Boot. The implementation includes RESTful services, logging, XML-based bean configuration, dependency injection, and structured multi-layered architecture (Controller, Service, DAO).

---

## ðŸ§ª Completed Hands-On Activities

### 1. **Spring Boot Project Setup**

* Created Spring Boot application using [Spring Initializr](https://start.spring.io).
* Used Maven for dependency management.
* Verified logging and application start via `main()` method.

---

### 2. **Spring Core and Dependency Injection**

* Configured beans using XML (`country.xml`, `date-format.xml`, `employee.xml`).
* Used `ApplicationContext` to load beans via `ClassPathXmlApplicationContext`.
* Demonstrated:

  * Singleton vs Prototype scopes
  * Constructor and setter injection
  * Collection (List) injection for `Country` and `Employee` beans

---

### 3. **Logging with SLF4J**

* Configured logging using `application.properties`.
* Replaced all `System.out.println()` with proper log levels (`info`, `debug`).
* Logged entry and exit for all service/controller methods.

---

### 4. **RESTful Web Services**

Implemented the following REST endpoints:

#### âœ… Hello World

* **URL:** `/hello`
* **Method:** GET
* **Output:** Plain text `"Hello World!!"`

#### âœ… Country APIs

* **GET /country** â€“ Returns India bean from `country.xml`
* **GET /countries** â€“ Returns list of countries (`countryList`)
* **GET /countries/{code}\`** â€“ Returns country by ISO code (case insensitive)
* **Invalid Code Handling** â€“ Returns HTTP 404 with `"Country not found"` message

#### âœ… Employee APIs

* Loaded 4 employees via `employee.xml` using `List<Employee>` bean
* **GET /employees** â€“ Returns list of all employees

#### âœ… Department APIs

* Loaded multiple departments via `employee.xml`
* **GET /departments** â€“ Returns list of all departments

---

### 5. **DAO, Service, Controller Layers**

Followed best practices for REST architecture:

* `@Controller`, `@Service`, and `@Repository/DAO` layers
* `@Transactional` on service methods
* Business logic decoupled from controller logic

---

## ðŸ§ª Testing

* All services were tested via **Postman** and **cURL**
* Verified correct JSON structure and HTTP status codes
* Confirmed backend logic independently of any frontend (Angular)

---

## ðŸš« Angular Integration

> The original document references Angular frontend integration to render forms and consume REST APIs.
> However, **Angular implementation was not part of this training program** and has been **excluded** from this backend-focused hands-on.

## 🎯 Purpose

This repository serves as a **practical submission workspace** for the DN4.0 Java FSE learning program.  
It is designed to:

- Document weekly hands-on assignments.
- Apply concepts from modules such as design patterns, data structures, Spring Boot, REST APIs, microservices, etc.
- Track personal progress and reinforce learning through implementation.

Each submission reflects learning from the self-paced modules and SME-led sessions.
